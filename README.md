## 📝 About

Fant-Home is a twin-stick shooter.  
You play as a ghost hunter vehicle and survive waves of aggressive ghosts to win.

## 🏎️ Main feature

I had the opportunity to learn behavior trees to add to this project.  
In fact, most of the enemies have a behavior tree that responds to rules that we've set up beforehand.  
Using this method enabled me to prioritize the importance of the behaviors that the enemies must perform.
